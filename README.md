### Howdy neighbor! 👋

<h3>My name is Garrett Thor, and I'm a software engineer</h3>

💻 I work with JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, MongoDB, CSS3, and HTML5.

⚽️ I love leading and working with a team in pursuit of creative endeavors!

🍸 I was a bar manager in a previous life.

Hello, and welcome!  Coding new and exciting experiences is my passion. I want to help our community thrive through elegant and thoughtful design, bringing life to business ideas and shining a light on amazing new concepts.
 
I enjoy the pursuit of lofty goals, challenging myself to reach beyond what I thought was previously achievable. I enjoy working both as a leader and a team member and know the virtue of knowing which hat to wear and when. My background in managing a top-tier craft cocktail bar has taught me innumerable soft skills and how to achieve amazing things all while having a great time.

When I’m not building or sharpening new skills, I enjoy backpacking, modern and retro video games, and exploring new culinary and cocktail experiences.
