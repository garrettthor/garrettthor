### Howdy neighbor! 👋

My name is Garrett Thor, and I am a software engineer.  I enjoy working with teams of diverse and wonderful coders to come together and solve problems and create wonderful new pieces of technology!

I like videogames, cocktails, backpacking, and creating with friends!  Let's go!
